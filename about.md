## About

Hi, I'm Zach. I'm a Master's student at Georgia Tech studying computer science. Specifically, I specialize in Machine Learning with strong interests in natural language processing, generative A.I., and mechanistic interpretability. What this means is that I am particularly fascinated by Large Language Models and text-to-image models, and one day I hope to understand how they learn, decode how they think, and extract the algorithms they implement. Outside of intellectual curiosity, demystifying the black-box nature of neural networks will allow us to create _safe_, _trustworthy_, and _reliable_ models.

I am currently associated with the <a href="https://lf.gatech.edu/" target="_blank">Low Frequency Radio Group</a> for my Master's thesis in machine learning for forecasting space weather. I am also a Graduate Research Assistant at the <a href="https://markolab.org/" target="_blank">MarkoLab</a> working within the domain of computational neuroscience to design and train models on mice activity.

My plan is to begin a Ph.D. in Fall 2024, so I'm currently applying to schools. Wish me luck!

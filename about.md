## About

Hi, I'm Zach. I'm a Master's student at Georgia Tech studying computer science. Specifically, I specialize in Machine Learning with strong interests in natural language processing, generative A.I., and mechanistic interpretability. What this means practically is that I am fascinated by Large Language Models and text-to-image models, and one day I hope to understand how they learn, decode how they think, and extract the algorithms they implement.

I am currently associated with the [Low Frequency Radio Group](https://lf.gatech.edu/) for my Master's thesis in machine learning for forecasting space weather. I am also a Graduate Research Assistant at the [MarkoLab](https://markolab.org/) working on models within the domain of computational neuroscience.

My plan is to begin a Ph.D. in Fall 2024, so I'm currently applying to schools.

## Projects

<a href="https://github.com/Rochan-HM/dlt-project" target="_blank">DesignerGPT</a>

Project I for CSE 8803-DLT, Deep Learning for Text Data during the Fall 2023 semester at Georgia Tech. This project tests a human-in-the-loop strategy for improving the performance of Large Language Models (LLMs) at design-based tasks (the use-case we focus on is web design). Specifically, we use <a href="https://openai.com/research/gpt-4" target="_blank">GPT-4</a> as our model, and incorporate the <a href="https://github.com/microsoft/autogen" target="_blank">AutoGen</a> framework to create multiple specialized agents that have a specific role in the overall design process. These agents communicate with each other to create a better output than a normal GPT-4 workflow, especially after corrective/guiding input from the user. We observe improved performance via more useful, stylized, and fleshed-out web pages.
